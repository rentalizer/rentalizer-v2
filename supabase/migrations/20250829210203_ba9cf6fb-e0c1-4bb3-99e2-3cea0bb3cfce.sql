-- Fix critical security vulnerability in guidebooks table
-- Issue: Unpublished property details (addresses, WiFi, check-in procedures) accessible to anyone
-- Solution: Ensure strict separation between public and private guidebook access

-- Drop existing policies to rebuild them securely

-- Create secure public SELECT policy - ONLY for published guidebooks
